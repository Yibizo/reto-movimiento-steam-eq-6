# Introduction

## Purpose
Create a video game focused on inspiring vocations in STEM (Biotechnology, Agriculture and Livestock, Physicomathematical and Earth Sciences, ICT Software and Services, Industrial engineering and transportation, Pharmaceuticals and biotechnology), as well as dveelop cognitive abilities (creativity, communication, colaborative work, crticial thinking, problem-solving, data alphabetization, digital alphabetization and computational sciences). In addition to this, track and register all user data and activity within the videogame in order to determine its effciency. 

## Scope
- Benefits: inclusion of women within STEM vocations, as well as the promotion of said subjects
- Objectives: break barriers, myths and prejudices describing that those types of careers are only for men
- Goals: Proximity to STEM subjects, without any gender discrimination

## Definitions and Acronyms
- STEM: science, technology, engineering, and mathematics education
- STEAM: science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics education
- RPG: role playing game
- RNG: random number generator, often only refers to events determined by random chance
- terminal: refers to a terminal that can be seen within any modern code editor
- dashboard: type of interface which presents information to the user

# Overall Description
The team's going to build a turn-based rpg with a focus on programming from scratch. Combat will be replaced with basic terminal problems and questions in order to explore said topic, as well as an overworld to promote critical-thinking. The videogame will be hosted within a webpage created by the team. Finally, user data and activity inside the videogame will be tracked, registered and displayed within the website to show the game's efficieny in terms of encouragement towards STEM vocations.

## User classes
- External users: Any user interested in playing the game. They need to be able to acces the website, play the game and compare their player stats top others.
- STEM members: Users that are focused on viewing player stats and evaluating whether or not the game achieved its goals. They need to be able to access the website and view player stats.

## Assumptions and Dependencies
- We may not be able to develop the project until our professors teach us the subjects necessary for its evolution.
- We may deliver a different product to what STEM is asking because of the unclarity of the requirements, as well as how long its taking to get specifics.
- We may be constraint by time and only be able to finish one world, as opposed to the expected three. 
- The client may not be satisfied with the videogame due to its prototype state.

# System Features and Requirements

## Functional Requirements
- Have a complete and playable videogame
- Host the videogame within the webpage
- Track player data corresponding to activity inside the videogame
- Display player information in order to determine videogame effciency according to its objectives

## External Interface Requirements

- User:
    - Have a playable videogame that is not too hard and frustrating, but also not too easy and boring that induces STEM abilities.
    - Have a clear and inductive way to access user data according to the videogame's efficieny
- Hardware
    - 4gb of RAM
    - Intel Core I3 or AMD Ryzen 3
    - 500mb of storage
    - 2.0GHz processor
- Software
    - Any modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, etc.)

## Non-functional Requirements
- The product must be on a website platform
- The product must be able to run on a PC with 4gb of RAM and 2.0GHz processor
- The database must register user actions and progress within the videogame
- The videogame must have at least one overworld, with one final boss
- The videogame must be hosted within a webpage
- The website must display user data with high precision
- The user profile data is confidential and must comply with mexican privacy laws
- Users have the right to audit their data and request their removal from the system

# Screens
The website consists of three pages; the landing page, the dashboard displaying user data and the page where the videogame is hosted.

- The landing page includes the games title and a brief description in order to motivate the visitor to play the videgame.
- The dashboard includes graphs and data of user information and intercations within the videogame in order to evaluate the game efficieny.
- The third, where the videogame is hosted, just involves a fullscreen view of the game.

The videogame itself contains a few different screens.

- The 2.5D overworld which can be explored, in addition to including puzzles and leading to combat determined by RNG.
- Combat, in which you are able to see enemy stats, your stats and options for the turn, which also includes the terminal. 
- Cutscenes, which are brief and offer no player interaction, apart from skipping said cutscene.
- Menu screens in which file saves can be accesed and options can be modified.

## Wireframes (WIP)
Wireframes are simple page layouts that outline the size and placement of elements, and features on a page. They are generally devoid of color, font styles, logos or any design elements.

Wireframing is probably the most time-consuming step of this process and for some simple projects, it may be overkill. For complex projects where serious design thinking needs to happen, wireframes are an indispensable tool.
